üåê Task 05 ‚Äì Network Packet Analyzer (Python)
Objective:
Develop a Python-based network packet analyzer to monitor, capture, and display details of network traffic in real-time.

Key Features:

Captures live packets from the network interface

Displays essential packet details: source IP, destination IP, protocol, and port

Filters packets based on protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

Lightweight terminal-based interface for analysis

Skills Demonstrated:

Low-level network monitoring with Python

Use of libraries like socket or scapy for packet sniffing

Protocol parsing and header analysis

Real-time data capture and filtering logic

Purpose:
This task provided insight into how packet sniffers work and how data moves across networks. It helped strengthen my understanding of the OSI model, protocols like TCP/IP, and introduced me to practical aspects of network forensics.
